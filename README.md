# Full Stack App with React and a REST API
### Project 10 from the Treehouse Full Stack Javascript TechDegree program. 

**Displays knowledge of Node.js, Express, SQL ORM Sequelizer, React JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.**

*_This final project correlates with project 9 of the Team Treehouse Fullstack TechDegree Program_*

This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, view details to a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database with the condition of creating a user account.
